Netsu is a Wordle-style game for guessing characters from Netsu No Kiseki. You pick an character set from the list of characters, and get guess feedback based on the character's region, gender, weapon, affiliation and age, with the aim of guessing the randomly selected character within ten guesses. Built with React, Tailwind and Framer Motion, the project is heavily inspired by the already exisitng [Genshindle](https://genshindle.com), but for our personal DnD Champaign.

## How To Play

1. A random, unknown character is selected.
2. Type and select a character from the given list.
3. The game compares your guess and tells you which attributes (name, gender, region, weapon, affiliation & age) are a match or close match to the answer.
4. Keep guessing until either you guess the correct character or hit 10 guesses.
5. Try to build up a streak of wins and aim for a high score.
